          Discord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can
          collaborate, share, and just talk about your day without clogging up a
          group chat.

          Grab a seat in a voice channel when you’re free. Friends in your
          server can see you’re around and instantly pop in to talk without
          having to call.
